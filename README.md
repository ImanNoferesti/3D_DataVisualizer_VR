# 3D Scatter Plot Data Visualizer in Unity VR

This Unity VR application provides a powerful and intuitive way to visualize large datasets in 3D space. It is designed to handle both discrete and continuous values, offering unique functionality to improve clarity in dense and overlapping data regions. For continuous data, users can apply rounding, ceiling, or flooring operations to group similar values, enabling a more focused and customizable analysis.

## 🌟 Features
* **Immersive VR Visualization:** Explore datasets in a fully interactive 3D environment.
* **Discrete and Continuous Value Support:** Works seamlessly with both discrete categories and continuous numerical data.
* **Dynamic Point Dispersion:** Generates equidistant points around overlapping data to improve trend and concentration visualization.
* **Value Grouping Options:**
    * **Rounding:** Groups continuous values by rounding to the nearest significant figure.
    * **Ceiling:** Groups values to the nearest upper bound.
    * **Flooring:** Groups values to the nearest lower bound.
* **Customizable Display:** Modify visual elements such as plot scale, point size, and color, to suit your data and analysis needs.

## 💡 Use Cases
* 🔍 Exploratory data analysis
* 📊 Trend identification in large or complex datasets
* 🎓 Academic research requiring immersive data exploration
* 🌐 Visualization of high-dimensional or dense data
